### Due: Sunday @ 12pm - Points: 5
### Assignment
Create a new project using the code from the last emotion assignment.

Remove all timer related changes and movement.

Create a UI with the following:
* An ofxFloatSlider to control the sound volume 
* An ofxButton to rotate between which emotion is being displayed
* An ofxVec2Slider to change the x,y of all shapes being drawn
* An ofxColorSlider to select the color of one shape in the drawing
* An ofxIntSlider shape movement (degree of emotion)
* Appropriate labels

Use translation, scaling, and rotation to add at least 3 new features to the existing emotions.

Ex:

Y rotation could make eyes squint/blink or eyebrows arch.

Scaling could widen eyes in surprise or narrow them in distrust

Translation could move pupils (or any other feature) around.



## Questions
What are the first 4 arguments of the slider setup method?

From the guiExample .h file, what types of sliders are available?

If the difference between them is in their return value, what do they return and how does this affect the values you can pass to setup?
