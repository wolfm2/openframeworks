### Assignment
## Due: Sunday May 12th @ 12pm - Points: 15

  Your goal is to translate a JSON data source into an intelligible visual form.  All of the
code should be bespoke (no functionality copied from online sources). The deliverable is not required to be a dashboard with associated UI (as you might see on a mobile).  You are incouraged to think non-literally about the data source and and imagine an innovative or engaging experience that could be derived from the structure.

  Since all projects will cover a domain of time, a slider for each variable is required for testing.
  
## Requirements

The visualization will include color, shapes, movement, text, fonts

A UI to manually change each variable used

A github link submitted to canvas with code, process assets, and the appropriate .md information

An explanation of your process in the .md

## Optional

Alternate web-APIs will be provided in class.  If you want to use a different API, come to me having already looked at the returned JSON data structure and propose your concept.  If I approve, you can use it.
